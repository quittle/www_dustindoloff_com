I wanted to be able to manage my files easier than SFTP, so I did my best to copy the drag and click feel of modern file managers. I also added a handy feature at the bottom, a console to be able to execute programs on the backend. As far as I've found, it was a pretty novel idea. I could "cd" through the console or use keyboard or clicks to navigate. The console would take input and display output from programs you wanted to execute. As I worked further on this project, I quickly realized how dangerous it was to have lying around publicly displayed, even with authentication, so I discontinued work on it.
