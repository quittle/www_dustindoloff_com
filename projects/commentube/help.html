<h1>How to use</h1>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
Copy and paste a youtube link into the input box at the top.  Hit ENTER or click "Load video"
<br /><br />
<h2>Step 2</h2>
Now you'll see your video displayed with a grey box to the right.  You can resize the video player by dragging the dividing bar<br />
The video player is very simplistic. You can see a progress bar at the bottom and no icons.  Nothing is missing, they just don't exist.<br />
Click the video to toggle play and pause.
<h2>Step 3</h2>
Left-click and drag on the video to draw on a particular frame.  You can use this tool to draw pictures, arrows, anything you want to help clarify or emphasize your comment.<br />
You can clear your drawing by right-clicking or playing the video.  There is a little extra space around the edges so you don't need to draw inside the lines.<br />
Underneath the video you'll see a little grey box and a form to type. The grey box will show you the time you are commenting on. You can type your comment inside the text form. <strong>You need a text comment to post, but a drawing is optional</strong><br />
Submit your comment with ENTER. You can type new lines with SHIFT+ENTER.
<h2>Step 4</h2>
Comments appear in little "pips" at the bottom of the video. Hover over them to see what they say.<br />
The grey box on the right of the video will scroll up as the video plays.  The middle-most comment is closest in relevance to the current video time.<br />
Comments below the input form are arranged most recent on top
